Sneak CDN-inserting buttons into [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/)'s "Preparation code HTML" TextBox.

## ToDo

* update exsisting refrences
* select older versions
* [branch aliasing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#version-aliasing)

## WillNotDo

* 'latest' version aliasing; bad practice since over a year updates will throw net results.  Please make a new revsion, update versions of external files, & make comment of what you've done.
